# AndroidAppForMVCApplication
This is an android application written in Java with Android Studio for my previous ASP.Net NTierMVCApp web application's mobile side. It uses Volley module to communicate with the web application's APIs. It has designed in order to have all the functionalities from the web application. It has not finished yet, I'm still working on it. I'm working on locally, in my scenario, my web site is being served from 192.168.1.120/10617, so you should change the apiUrl variable in Request classes from ApiService/Requests to your exact web application's Url and also you should check your responses from the web application if you have your own. Because it will response back different JSONs from mine probably. For now, order and shopping cart functions are done but request and response parts are weak in both web and android app and I have to make some changes for more safe communication. I will finish those parts as soon as possible.
